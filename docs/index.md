### Scenario

The group wants to develop a chat. A system user could search for another user and start to communicate with him creating a chat with him. The goal is to let users communicate with each other sending messages in chats.

### Course requirements

The system will be designed with a microservices approach. After an initial knowledge crunching session will be selected what microservices will be developed. In order to isolate microservice, the team will use Docker to put in container the microservices; but they needs to comunicate each other about what happened in each of them, so the communication will be implemented with an event bus. The team will have a tough challenge when choosing which of the CAP theorem they want to choose in the system.
